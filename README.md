# Router-DOM

This project is a React application bootstrapped with Vite. It serves as a template providing a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules.

## Features

- **React with Vite**: Utilizes Vite for fast development and build processes.
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Enabled for efficient development.
- **ESLint Configuration**: Includes basic ESLint rules for code quality.
